### Authentication

[Securing Passwords](https://thehackernews.com/2014/04/securing-passwords-with-bcrypt-hashing.html)
##### 1. Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password.
Basically, to safely hash a password you would apply an algorithm that mixes up the plain text and then makes it harder for a computer to unscramble it. 

##### 2. What is Bcrypt?
Bcrypt is a hashing algorithm that doesn't just jumble up the password, it also significantly slows down the speed by which a computer can illegitimately unscramble it. Criminals prefer to smash and grab rather than invest long periods of time to getting into something. So if you slow down the computers long enough it's no longer worth their while to crack the passwords.

##### 3. Why might you use something like Bcrypt?
_If you have security infrastructure that lets you trace and/or disconnect an ongoing attack in time, x and your Bcrypted password database slows down the time it takes to crack the hashed passwords to 2x, then your attackers chances of success are significantly reduced._

[Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
##### 1. What is Basic Authentication?
"_In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and passwrod when making a request._ " -Wikipedia

##### 2. What properties are necessary in the header of a Basic Auth request?
_"Authorization: Basic <credentials>, where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon :."_ -Wikipedia

##### 3. How are `username:password` in Basic Auth encoded?
_This is encoded into an octet sequence._ 


[OWASP auth cheatsheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet)
##### 1. Define the authentication process to a non-technical recruiter.
_Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is authorized to access sensitive information. This is done by requiring that they provide verifying information that only an authorized person should have like an valid username and password combination._ 

##### 2. How should your error messaging respond (both HTTP and HTML)? Why?
_"An application should respond (both HTTP and HTML) in a generic manner."_ 

##### 3. Bookmark this link also and consider OWASP fundamentals any time you interact with authentication. Applications developed with security in mind from inception have fewer vulnerabilities throughout their lifecycle.
