## API Integration

[Review API Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/api-server/)

1. Explain the difference between a query string parameter and a path parameter.

_"While query parameters describe how to look, path parameters show your program where to look. Path parameters are part of the endpoint URI and are required to have a value. Think of path parameters as the file system in your endpoint URL, guiding the request to the answer it seeks."_ [Source](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+the+difference+between+a+query+string+parameter+and+a+path+parameter%3F&oq=what+is+the+difference+between+a+query+string+parameter+and+a+path+parameter%3F&aqs=chrome..69i57.11809j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

2. What would our API URL with a path id parameter be, given the following information:

_"The path parameter is separated from the URL by a `/`, and from the query parameter(s) by a question mark (`?`)."_

  1. Domain: `http://our-site.com`

    http://our-site.com/{id}    -- the id must be replaced with an actual value

  2. `v3`

    

  3. model name: `stuff`


  4. id: `things`


3. We have created a dynamic API with an "interface". Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend. 


[Review Auth Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/auth-server/)

1. Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.


2. Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.


3. Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.
