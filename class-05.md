#### 04/08/2022: Read 05 - HTML Images; CSS Color & Text
#### HTML Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)
  * alternatives to photoshop: pixlr.com, splashup.com, ipiccy.com
  * < figure> allows more than one image to share the same caption
  * great example of using tags to set up a page of images and captions resides on pg 122


#### HTML Chapter 11: “Color” (p.246-263)
  * consider using different colors for different header levels
  * hue, saturation, brightness -- all discussed with examples on pg 252
  * "The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color...but adds a fourth value for opacity." -text pg 254
  
#### HTML Chapter 12: “Text" (pp.264-299)
  * line-height -roughly stated is the space above a line of text; it is measured in ems and can be increased/decreased per developer preference
  * letter-spacing -allows for kerning modification
  * word-spacing -adjusts horizontal spacing between words
  * text-align:left (right, center, or justify)
        
#### Additional Resource: [Blog Post: JPEG vs PNG vs GIF](https://blog.imagekit.io/jpeg-vs-png-vs-gif-which-image-format-to-use-and-when-c8913ae3e01d)
* "Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations." -TL;DR (from the source link)
    
#### `Why this topic matters`
* I spent a good amount of time trying to use align:"left" and align:"right". Now that I've read page 103 of the text which explains that the align attribute has been removed from HTML5 I'm feeling a might bit less inept.
    
#### `Analogy `
* Like when you get a really long list of instructions and your first instinct is to skip over the introductory/background material even though that's the most likely place to find a line like "Be sure to place close attention to the instructions with regard to "blah".
        
#### `Things I want to know more about`
* I'd be interested to know if there are CSS rules/attributes/etc for bleeding edges of boxes or colors into each other by degrees. I can wait until I've absorbed the current material, but I do wonder how much of a swirling miasma one can attain while setting up divs.
