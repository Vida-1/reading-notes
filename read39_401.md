## Redux - Additional Topics

[Redux Toolkit (RTK)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

1. What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?
  
   * overly complicated store configuration
   * excessive package installation requirements
   * excessive boilerplate code requirements 

2. What does `configureStore()` do?

  _"wraps `createStore` to provide simplified configuration options and good defaults. It can automatically combine your slice reducers, adds whatever Redux middleware you supply, includes `redux-thunk` by default, and enables use of the Redux DevTools Extension."_

3. How would I use `createSlice()`?

_"`createSlice()` accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types."_

[MobX](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html)
1. What is Mobx?

  _"MobX is a simple, scalable and battle tested state management solution... [ it] is a standalone library, but most people are using it with React..."_

2. How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?

MobX makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state by making all state changes automatic derivations based on an initial application state.

3. How would we build a reactive user interface?

First, we would make the properties of objects in the application "observable" so that MobX knows they (their values) can change, then we wrap the relevant constructor functions in  "autorun" which creates a reaction that runs once then automatically whenever state changes.

1. What take-away(s) did this tutorial provide?

* A primary goal for a developer should be understanding enough tools well enough to be able to select the best tool for a project to avoid excessive complexity (which can be costly)

* React Hooks have only been around since about 2018

* Connect is hard to use with Typescript

### Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-39/)?

My learning goals will reflect the same as those of the curriculum.
