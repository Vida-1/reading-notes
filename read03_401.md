### Express REST API

[Review: ES6 Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

#####  1. Classes are a template for creating ____ .
    Objects.

#####  2. Can a class declaration be hoisted?
     Yes classes can be hoisted though it's values aren't initialized.

#####  3. How would you describe a constructor and contextual "this" to a non-technical friend?
      A constructor is what groups and frames how to arrange the data in the "thing" (aka object) that you are processing.

#####  1. Within Express, what does routing refer to?
  Routing refers to handling "endpoints" that dictate where to CRUD something.

#####  2. What is the difference between a route path and a route method?
  "A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class." I'll need to read/digest a bit more to know what this really means.

#####  3. When is it appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler and what must you do if next has been passed to your middleware as a parameter?
  When next is passed to middleware as a parameter, it passes control from the current handler to the next handler in the program.

#####  1. What is an Express Router?
  An express router is a small app that encapsulates the routing functionality of your server.

#####  2. [What do we mean by] initialize express.Router() in an express server?
  It means to start the mini-program within our server where we coded how the routing should be handled.

#####  3. What do we use route middleware for?
  We use it to do something (or check that something has been done) before we finalize a user's request. 

###  Reflections
#####  What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
  To build a new REST API server using Express and try to figure out the basics of using Postgres.

#####  Things I want to know more about
  Using express - I'm hoping to find some time over the holiday break to run through a mini-project using express.
