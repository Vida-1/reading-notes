#### [An Introduction to Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

#### `How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?`
* I would say to think of it as a compiler built specifically to facilitate information/data processing requests made via a web browser.
    
#### `What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?`
* This means that it is a compiler that translates the comparatively high-level (human friendly) JavaScript programming language into a simpler, low level (computer friendly) machine language that the computer can understand and execute.
        
#### `What is Node used for?`
* Node is used to manage the myriad small software packages stored on your computer that handle web browser data processing.

#### `Things I want to know more about`
* This is important but arguably "dry" reading. It'd be great to pick up a few mnemonic devices to retain the details longer.

#### `Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?`
* I look forward to practicing the rote commands enough that I feel more like I know what I'm doing.

#### `What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?`
* Effective lab implementation of the material.
