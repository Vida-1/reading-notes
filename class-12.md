* Will have to give this article another read while dabbling on-screen    

#### `Why this topic matters`
* Honestly not sure yet why this matters really. I mean it seems novel, but outdated. Could be though that I’m not fully grasping things.
    
#### `Analogy `
* I don’t have one for this.
        
#### `Things I want to know more about`
* There’s nothing here I’d like to know more about at this time.
