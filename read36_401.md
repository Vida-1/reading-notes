3. Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.

4. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and why it is useful.

### Additional Questions

1. Looking ahead at this module’s [course schedule](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/#module-8), What do you look forward to learning?

 "Asynchronous actions" looks simultaneously terrifying and intriguing.

2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-36/)?

I would love to be able to explain "global state management with a redux store" more or less in my own words and be able to competently generate Redux boilerplate by the end of this module.
