[Today's Lab Requirements](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-09/lab/)

##### 1. Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.
* an app that lets users log in to access a database of info about Star Fleet captains and depending on their authorization, CRUD the info;

* something that lets you add feedback on how your pets react to their foods/snacks (i.e. "liked it for a while then not after a week", "hated it from the beginning.")
