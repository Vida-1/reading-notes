#### *Why This Topic Matters As it Relates to This Module*
We are integrating data from online sources using APIs in this week's lab assignments.

### [API Design Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)
#### 1. What does REST stand for?
Representational State Transfer

#### 2. REST APIs are designed around a ____.
resource

#### 3. What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.
"A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be: https://adventure-works.com/orders/1 " _directly quoted from the article_

#### 4. What are the most common HTTP verbs?
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, & DELETE

#### 5. What should the URIs be based on?
"When possible, resource URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource)."  _directly quoted from the article_

#### 6. Give an example of a good URI.
https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good

#### 7. What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
An API that exposes a large number of small resources is considered "chatty" and is unfortunate as it may "require a client application to send multiple requests to find all of the data that it requires" resulting in increased load on the server. _quoted from the article_

#### 8. What status code does a successful GET request return?
code 200 (OK)

#### 9. What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?
code 204 (No Content)

#### 10. What status code does a successful POST request return?
code 201 (Created)

#### 11. What status code does a successful DELETE request return?
code 204 (No Content)
