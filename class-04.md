#### 04/07/2022: Read 04 - Pair Programming: More Extensions to About Me

#### HTML Chapter 4: “Links” (pp.74-93)
* Chapter talks about linking between pages, other websites, and opening email programs with pre-populated destination field.
* Other related info on links - just skimmed this one.
  
#### HTML Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)
  * floats and floating info is on pgs 370-374 -Note to self: check this section more closely for clues on the Lab 03 image puzzle
  * "The clear property allows you to say that no element within the same containing element should touch the left or right-hand sides of a box." -pg 372

#### JS Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)
  * function getArea (width, height) { return width * height; } <-- from pg 92 this code block calculates the area and returns it to the program. To use it you would "call" the function for example by saying getArea (2, 5). This would cause the calculation (2*5) to run and return the value 10. Unclear as yet on whether getArea without parenthesis would then function as a variable containing that value.
    

    
#### Additional Resource: Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”
* The four basic skills that help you learn a language are listening and speaking, reading and writing. This breakdown also applies to learning to communicate fluently with co-workers in the coding space.
    
#### `Why this topic matters`
* The skills acquired through pair programming are invaluable for getting through a tech interview and make you a much more valuable employee; one who is able to speak clearly and concisely about a coding problem and possible solutions as opposed to one whose stand-up meeting contributions too often include words like "the thing", "the part that", "random" errors (computer errors are never random!) etc.
    
#### `Analogy `
* I think the article's indication that learning coding communication is analogous to spoken language learning is appropos. There is even the same unfortunate tendancy to want to "learn more" before trying to use it, that plagues spoken language learners!
        
#### `Things I want to know more about`
* Again, I have to say "all of it". I didn't balance out my day very well with regard to reading and book work vs. hands-on coding and I wasn't very efficient at either. Of the three book chapters listed above I'd say the one I'm most anxious to look over in more detail is the one on JS Functions, Methods and Objects.
