### Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

[An Introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)


1. `Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.`
    Middleware (with regard to web frameworks) is a term used to describe software libraries that wre created to address ancillary web development requirements. 

2. `Express the most popular __ __ ____.`
    _"Express is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks."_

3. `Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?`
    _"Opinionated frameworks are those with opinions about the "right way" to handle any particular task. ... Unopinionated frameworks, by contrast, have far fewer restrictions on the best way to glue components together to achieve a goal, or even what components should be used. ... Express is unopinionated. You can insert almost any compatible middleware you like into the request handling chain, in almost any order you like."_

4. `What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?`
    _"A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function."_ Modularity is useful because it allows the dev to build upon the earlier successes of others rather the wasting time re-inventing a wheel (component) that has been noodled out already by someone else. Modularity also allows for more efficient maintenance as updates as deprecation can be handled more easily.

[What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)

1. `What version of npm are you running on your machine?`

    Version 8.5.0

2. `What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?`

    npm install -g jshint

[What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)

1. `Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.`

   Test Driven Development (TDD) 

2. `What are three expected benefits of testing?`
    * _"many teams report significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort"_

    * _"the same teams tend to report that these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases"_
    
    * _"although empirical research has so far failed to confirm this, veteran practitioners report that TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code, and more generally a higher degree of “internal” or technical quality, for instance improving the metrics of cohesion and coupling"_

3. `Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.`
    * Two individual pitfalls include forgetting to run the tests often enough and also writing too many of them at once.

    * Two team pitfalls include partial adoption and poor maintenance of the test suites over the course of the project.

[CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

1. `What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?`

    * catch bugs
    * reduce merge conflicts
    * reduce bottlenecks

2. `What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?`

    Continuous delivery (CD) is a software development strategy in which the product can be released at any time while continuous deployment refers to releasing new feature builds. Right now these semantics seem to be hair-splitting but hopefully the applicable difference is more obvious after more study and practice. 

3. `Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background.`

    GitHub allows multiple people to work on the same code project simultaneously. As a worker completes a portion of code it needs to be integrated into the project as a whole along with the changes made by others; GitHub facilitates that in such a way that people are overwriting each other's work, or breaking the code base. GitHub also creates a historical record and back up copies of EVERY piece of code in case things need to be rolled back, or examined at any point. There are many, many other practical features that GitHub facilitates as well, all aimed at helping coding teams collaborate more efficiently.

### Reflection
`What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?`

I don't think I have any new goals after reviewing the README but maybe I looked at the wrong document. I'll have to revisit this.
