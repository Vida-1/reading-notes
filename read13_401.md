#### Reading

[Socket.io Chat Example](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/)

1. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.

_This example creates a chat app in about 20 lines of code._

2. What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?

_The above app sends backend proof of life in the form of console logs: 'listening on *:3000', 'a user connected', 'a user disconnected'._

3. Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?

_"If you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket, we have the `broadcast` flag for emitting from that socket"_

[Rooms](https://socket.io/docs/v4/rooms)

1. What is a room and how might a room be useful?

_"A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients"_

2. How do you join a room?

You join a room by calling the `join` method.

3. how do you leave a room?

_"To leave a channel you call leave in the same fashion as join."_

[Namespaces](https://socket.io/docs/v4/namespaces/)

1. What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?

_"A Namespace is a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection (also called "multiplexing")."_

2. Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)

Each namespace potentially has its own event handlers, rooms, and middlewares.

3. Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces.

I don't understand this well enough from this particular reading to discuss either of the possible use cases mentioned. I'll have to circle back after further study.

#### Reflection
What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

My goal is to study more and gain more understanding of this topic.

`Things I'd like to know more about:`

Use cases within gaming if any exist.
