#### 04/06/2022: Read 03 - HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

#### HTML Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)
* < dl>< /dl> definition list
  * < dt>< /dt> definition term
  * < dd>< /dd> term definition
  
#### HTML Chapter 13: “Boxes” (p.300-329)
  * div { height: 300px; width: 400px; background-color: #ee3e80;}  <-- this is an example of how to set the size of a box from the text page 303
  * pg 305 discusses limiting height using min-height and max-height while 306 addresses handling of overflow content
  * one can specify border-width, border-style, and border-color individually or in one fell swoop (border)
  * padding refers to space between content and border while margin refers to space between border of one box and the next adjacent one
  * with CSS3 one can construct boxes with rounded corners

#### JS Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions" (pp.70-73)
* this reading segment is about arrays; the segment is brief but this is something I really want to get a strong grasp on so flagging it for more reading over the weekend.
    
#### JS Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops" (pp.162-182) 
* Clear as mud (flagging to revisit):
  * switch statements
  * type coercion 
  * truthy/falsy -even though she went over this in class, i'm not finding its purpose or usefulness to be intuitive
  * short circuit values
    
    
#### `Why this topic matters`
* The JS topics strike me as immensely important for coding effective logical statements. I really don't see how you COULD code anything useful without a firm understanding and command of these structures.
    
#### `Analogy `
* On Friday, a 2nd grade student declared to me after more or less successfully fumbling through a one-handed major scale on the piano "I got it now! I don't need to practice any more." I said, "Is that so? Awesome! Then do this!" and quickly ran the scale in a fraction of the time that it took him to do it exemplifying that understanding a facility are not at all the same thing. For the sections of the reading that I was able to understand, I am woefully aware that I as yet lack the facility to competently and efficiently weild these tools.
        
#### `Things I want to know more about`
* Pretty much all of it but while I "want" to get more practice in working with boxes, padding, and margins, I feel more a sense of urgency about securing competence with arrays, switch statements, type coercion, truthy/falsy and short circuit values.
