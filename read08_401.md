## Access Control (ACL)

[5 steps to RBAC](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3060780/security/5-steps-to-simple-role-based-access-control.html)
##### 1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
"RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization." We should care about RBAC as according to a referenced study, 81% of hack breaches are due to compromised access credentials.

##### 2. Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.

Assuming this question is just asking for examples:
  I might give someone with the title of "Technical Manager" access to all of the company's ongoing research documentation relevant to his division, but restrict his access to HR systems to only read access to his own benefits information. Likewise an HR Director may have access to all HR data but none of the company's ongoing research documentation. 

##### 3. What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
The article lays out what seems to be a reasonable approach involving starting with a systems inventory, analysis of the workforce and the creation and subsequent assiging of individuals to roles (I think this is where things get really tricky), adhering to the structure and resisting the convenience of making exceptions and then auditing the implementation to ensure that it maintains a satisfactory level of efficacy, accuracy, and security.

##### 1. If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?
Authorization would be answering the question of "are you allowed to have that information you're asking for?" 

##### 2. Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.
_"Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:_

  1. _Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role._
  2. _Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized._
  3. _Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized."_ 

##### 3. Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.
Role based access control is the practice of giving access to computer systems according to the role you play within the organization maintaining those systems. For example, if you are an art teacher your role precludes you from needing accesses to the athletic department's sporting equipment ordering platform. Having access to the whole kit and caboodle means that if someone guesses your password they can do a LOT more damage than they could if your access credentials only allow you access to a part of the organization and not all aspects of it. RBAC is risk mitigation.

##### 1. What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.
Access rights are associated with the role not the user. Bob Jones may move about within the organization and if he transfers from one department to another he will no longer have logical justification for maintaining access to the former department's data as access to that data is related to a role he no longer occupies. Access to systems allows us to do a job, if you don't need the access to do the job, you don't get the access in RBAC.

##### 2. Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?
After a user is successfully assigned a role, their access rights or authorization is activated.

##### 3. Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.
RBAC might benefit a business by decreasing risk related to credentials being compromised; it may also help a business maintain policy adherence for protecting sensitive information like HIPPA data, SEC related data, etc.

#### Reflection
What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
... and I quote:
* "Implement a permissions based access control middleware module."
* "Integrate back-end authorization controls using Express"... 
* "Use a virtual column for capabilities, to create a roles system."

#### `Things I want to know more about:`
Nothing related to the current topic at this time (though I'm writing this just prior to engaging the readings); however, I have made a couple of notes on things to circle back to time-permitting:
* How to use Wallaby (Prof mentioned it in slack earlier today); also,
* I was recently listening to an audio book that made reference to "g3doc", an internal engineering documentation platform over at the Google. I made a note to go back and see what more I could discover about that when I have time. A preliminary scan resulted in this link which is on my "to watch" list: https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program/presentation/macnamara
