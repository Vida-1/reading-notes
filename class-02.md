### 04/04/2022: Read 02 - HTML Text, CSS Intro, and Basic JS Instructions

### HTML Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)
  * HTML header fonts range from h1 (largest) to h6 (smallest)
  * paragraph tags will include a space between the paragraphs
  * some other font tags include: <b></b> (bold); <i></i> (italic); <sup></sup> (superscript); and <sub></sub> (subscript)
  * Definition: "white space collapsing" is the term for how HTML ignores more than 2 adjacent spaces

### HTML Chapter 10: “Introducing CSS” (p.226-245)
  * in CSS properties are delineated from values with an intervening colon and the declaration should be closed with a semi-colon
  * there is a listing of selector types with details on page 238 of the text
 
### JS Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions" (pp.53-84)
  * to multi-line comment code in JS:  /* comment comment comment */
  * to single-line comment conde in JS:  // comment comment comment
  
### JS Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops" (pp.145-162) 
*-only up to the section on switch statements*
  * == compares two things to see if they are the equal regardless of type correlation
  * === compares two things and they must be BOTH of the same data type and same value to return "true"

  * about the importance of writing good git commit messages 
  
### `Why does this topic matters`
Everything presented in this reading assignment is important and the reasons are pretty obvious, however to be specific about the JavaScript: one of the most important aspects of web design is to engage your audience and this is much easier to accomplish by employing dynamic interactions made possibly by inclusion of JavaScript. 
  
### `Analogy `
Last week I called a student to my desk to explain some work he had done a few days prior. I asked him to read his response to a question because I could not read his handwriting. When he was unable to do so, I instructed him to re-do the assignment. This greatly agitated my 8 year old nephew, however, the lesson he (hopefully) learned from the exercise is common to the wisdom offered by the additional resource link above on git commit messages: "There's no guarantee that you'll remember what you did or why you did days after an update, so clear and effective documentation (even if brief) is important not only to your own efficiency, but also in preventing others from deeming your work worthless.
      
### `Things I want to know more about`
I would like to know more about using JavaScript conditional statements to determine the contente presented on a web page. For example 
let responseOne = prompt('Did you have a good day? (y/n)')
if responseOne == "n" then a sad face image appears in <main> with a message of "Sorry to hear that, hope tomorrow is better for you."
however, if responseOne == "n" then in the same spot that would have been a 480x480px image, instead a 480x480px video is embedded and auto-played of a puppy dancing.
