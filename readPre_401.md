**Discussion Question 1: What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**

_To the field of Star Trek VR Curatorship, I bring the right mix of ingredients! There are tons of Star Trek fans out there, there are plenty of coders that are a few VR afficionados, there is an over-abundance of people who can successfully work remotely. I however am the tri-fecta: a fan of every flavor of Star Trek (yes even that one with the unfortunate into music) who codes for joy not just for money, who hasn't grown tired of VR and who has a proven track record for effectively contributing from a home office for many years._

**Discussion Question 2: What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**

_Three things I'll start doing to un-stick myself will be:_
- _Explain the goal and the blocker in as much detail as possible to one of my dogs. If they have no suggestions perhaps I'll then take the matter to a co-worker or classmate._ 
- _Afford some time to consider and examine corner or edge cases and not limit my problem solving to only a limited main case solution._ 
- _If stuck implementing a solution, I'll try writing it out completely in comments or pseudo-code and only after the pseudo solution is sound, go back and convert it into syntactic code._
