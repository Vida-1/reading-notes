The Can-of-Books project is all CRUD-dy.

#### 1. What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
"CRUD functions can exist in a REST API, but REST APIs are not limited to CRUD functions." -[Quoted from logicmonitor.com](https://www.logicmonitor.com/blog/rest-vs-crud#:~:text=In%20its%20base%20form%2C%20CRUD,not%20limited%20to%20CRUD%20functions.)

#### 2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
lorem ipsum
1. "The very first step in designing a REST API-based application is – identifying the objects which will be presented as resources."
2. "decide the resource URIs... URSs are the endpoints for APIs."
3. "Determine Resource Representations"
4. Assign the http methods
5. Address ancillary concerns such as logging, security, and discovery.
