Imagine you have a delicious stack of lifesavers. In my neck of woods the "normal" way to eat a roll of lifesavers is to peel off just one end of the tube so you can only see the topmost candy. You have no idea of what lay beneath this topmost candy and can only find out being POPping the top one off. Then you can see the NEXT one. It may have a different flavor value, but it doesn't necessarily have to. If however after you've taken a PEEK at what lies beneath the topmost candy and decide it isn't worth it to eat two candies that aren't to your liking you can PUSH the candy back into the wrapper, on top where you got it; however, please don't share the candy if you do this though, cuz COVID. Anyway, should you decide to move forward with processing the candies with your mastication function eventually you'll find that the wrapper ISEMPTY indicating your stack has been depleted.
