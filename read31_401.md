## Context API
[Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

1. What can React Context provide your app?
React Context provides you with a way to pass props through your app without having to adhere to the standard top-down (parent-to-child) approach; in other words we can skip passing props through elements to which those props are irrelevant.

2. Why might we use Context?
You might use Context when applying a themed user interface to your application.

3. Why should we use it sparingly?
The reading indicates that Context "makes component reuse more difficult". I will have to play around with it to fully understand why that is.

  * Takeaways  
    * Context is present in React >= 16.3 contains Context so no special installs are needed
    * "Calling the factory function `React.createContext()` will return us an object that has a “Provider” and a “Consumer” in it."
    * Provider feeds all it's sub-components
    * Consumer _"must have access to the same Context component"_
    *  [example usage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhWqy-vxKS8):  const MyContext = React.createContext("Hello");
