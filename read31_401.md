## Context API
[Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

1. What can React Context provide your app?
React Context provides you with a way to pass props through your app without having to adhere to the standard top-down (parent-to-child) approach; in other words we can skip passing props through elements to which those props are irrelevant.

2. Why might we use Context?
You might use Context when applying a themed user interface to your application.

3. Why should we use it sparingly?
It would seem that because Context shares data globally, it should be used sparingly to avoid unintentional collisions; however, this is not what the reading indicates. Rather, the reading indicates that Context "makes component reuse more difficult". I will have to play around with it to fully understand why that is.
