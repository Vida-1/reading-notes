  - _Key takeaways: Deliberate practice involves engaging in activities for the purpose of improving SPECIFIC aspects of one's skillset. You know where your weaknesses lie so you should take the lead on addressing them with frequently repeated activities that FORCE you to improve (i.e. if it's too easy it's not doing you much good, so step out of your comfort zone.)._

  - _Cultivating a appreciation for the growth mindset concept over fixed mindset is one of the biggest focal points for the kids I teach. I think once it has been adopted, the sky is the limit on what anyone (of any age) can accomplish._
* [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)
  - _"Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future day in day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint." -Angela Lee Duckworth_

  - _In short, don't get sucked into a passionless existence keeping up with the Joneses. This could arguably have been stated with significantly fewer words._

  - _Confirmed: Social awareness is not my strong suit._
* [Assess your biases](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.html)
  - _My strongest areas are understanding what bias is, and in meaningful connections. Unfortunately, my weakest area is acting with courage. In the coming weeks and beyond I (to paraphrase the assessment suggestion) look forward to challenging myself with new points of view or opinions from podcasts, new authors, and  documentaries as well as making efforts to meet and interact with people outside of my current social circle in order to learn and expand my perspective._

I very much look forward to learning what comes of Angela Lee Duckworth's challenge to the community to explore ways of teaching youngsters to be "grittier" in their pursuits!
