## AWS: Cloud Servers

[AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

1. What is an EC2 Instance?

    _"An Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure." [reference](https://www.google.com/search?q=What+is+an+EC2+Instance%3F&oq=what+is+&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i59j69i65l2j69i61l2j69i60.1657j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)_

2. Name 2 use cases for EC2.
    
    * running high performance computing (HPC) applications with more speed and (cost) efficiency
    * running cloud navit and enterprise applications

3. Provide 1 reason to use EC2 instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com

    EC2 is IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) while Heroku, Digital Ocean, and Render are all PaaS. Of significance between the two types of services is the difference in what the subscriber is handling vs what is being relinquished to the service to handle. A PaaS subscriber in effect gives up total control of deployment facets and focuses soley on their applications code and data. If retaining control of the minuteau of a deployment as well as having the ability to scale very quickly one would come out better subscribing to AWS's EC2 IaaS solution.
