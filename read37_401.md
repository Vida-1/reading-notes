## Redux - Combined Reducers

[Multiple Reducers Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBER4Or86hE)

1. Why create multiple reducers?
Storing a large amount of data within a single reducer (as objects with various pieces of data of various types) can be difficult to maintain.

2. How would you combine multiple reducers?
You combine reducers by importing the `combineReducers` method from the redux library and then declare the various individual reducers and one that holds them which calls the `combineReducers()` method.

3. How will you manage state as an immutable object? why?

Default states are set at declaration and then the changes are sent via dispatch payloads. To do this the default state value is over-written in the individual reducers with the new state and returned.

[Redux Docs: Using Combined Reducers](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/using-combinereducers/)
1. `combineReducers` is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing **REDUCER LOGIC**.

2. Explain how `combineReducers` assembles the new state tree.

_"In order to assemble the new state tree, `combineReducers` will call each slice reducer with its current slice of state and the current action, giving the slice reducer a chance to respond and update its slice of state if needed. So, in that sense, using `combineReducers` does "call all reducers", or at least all of the slice reducers it is wrapping."_

3. How would you define initial state in an app using `combineReducers`?

_"There are two ways to define the initial shape and contents of your store's state. First, the `createStore` function can take `preloadedState` as its second argument. This is primarily intended for initializing the store with state that was previously persisted elsewhere, such as the browser's localStorage. The other way is for the root reducer to return the initial state value when the state argument is undefined."_

1. Why will you want to split your reducing functions as your app becomes more complex?

Having your reducing functions each managing independent parts of state makes the data easier to manage and the coding cleaner as you won't have to employ complicated data drilling techniques to get to the pieces of data that is needed throughout the code base.

2. The `combineReducers` helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to `createStore`.

3. What is a popular convention when naming reducers?

_"A popular convention is to name reducers after the state slices they manage"_


### Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-37/)?

Same as the curriculum goals which are:
* Describe and Define
  *  How complex state can be broken down into multiple reducers
  * The sharing of actions between reducers
* Execute
  * Implementation of multiple reducers in a Redux app
  * Managing complex shared state between components

Just more time practicing the above.
