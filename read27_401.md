## useState() Hook
[Introducing Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#motivation)

**What was the motivation for introducing Hooks?**

React needed a "better primitive for sharing stateful logic" so that component hierarchy could remain unaltered.

**What changes are important regarding implementing Hooks versus Component Classes?**
* hook implementation is optional
* it is 100% backward compatible
* it is available as of React v16.8.0

**Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing** COMPONENT HEIRARCHY.


[hooks api](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)

**Name two rules imposed by React Hook usage.**

* _"Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions."_
* _"Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions."_

**How would you identify a custom Hook and why might you create one?**
Identification: _"If a function's name starts with `use` and it calls other Hooks, we say it is a custom Hook."_

_"You can write custom Hooks that cover a wide range of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, [and] timers" among other things.

**What is a Hook?**

_"A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features."_

**When would I use the useState Hook?**

You would use the useState Hook when you need to reuse state logic in multiple function components without having to alter your component heirarchy.

**If you were to add React state to a function component by declaring a state variable:**
* **What does calling useState do?**

Calling `useState` declares a state variable.

* **What do we pass to useState as an argument?**

We only pass the initial state to `useState` as an argument.

* **What does useState return?**

`useState` returns two things: the current state, and a function that updates the current state.

### Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-27/)?

My goal is to actually understand all of the words that I just read in this assignment.

`Things I'd like to know more about:`

I'd like to get a bit of practice in acutally using `useState` on a project of personal interest.
