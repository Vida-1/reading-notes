#### JS Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects" (pp.106-144)
* Object constructor notation: object.key = 'value';
* Updating an object: object.property = 'property_value';
* "Literal notation: a colon separates the key/value pairs. There is a comma between each key/value pair." - pg 113
* this.  keyword refers to objects where they lie
* browers have built-in objects that supply a variety of commonly required functions    

#### Additional Resource: [Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)
* "Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain." -the article opening
    
#### `Why this topic matters`
* Sometimes sharing information via a table is the most efficient course of action.
* Functions, methods, and objects make the world go 'round in all of the programming languages. This is a required skillset for a developer and useful to pretty much everyone/anyone regardless of their work specifics if they spend time on computers.
    
#### `Analogy `
* A developer not learning functions, methods, and objects is akin to a ditch digger showing up to work with no shovel and two sprained wrists.
        
#### `Things I want to know more about`
* I'd like to acquire more facility with coding functions, methods, and objects.
