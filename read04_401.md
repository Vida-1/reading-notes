#####  1. What type of database is the best fit for the complex query environment?
"SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment"

##### 2. What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?
"NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data."

##### 3.Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.
There are two types of scalability: vertical and horizontal. "In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable." this means you can increase scale by improving hardware like getting a faster CPU more RAM or bigger harddrive on the server to handle more data. "NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable." which means you can add more SERVERS to increase data capacity. You can't just add servers to an SQL database because you can't split the data onto different machines when it's in a relational database and all tied up together.

#####  1. Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?
An example of a one to many relationship is having a table of customers where each customer has a unique email address. Each one of your customers may place multiple orders over time. This is a one (customer) to many (orders) relationahip.

##### 2. Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.
Determine a schema of database tables and their relationships.

##### 3. Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.
A primary key sits at the foundation of your database and serves to make each record unique, it is immutable. A foreign key comes from a secondary or tertiary table.

##### 1. How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?
Keywords and parameters in NoSQL look a bit like JSON while keywords and parameters in SQL appear more grammatically like prose.

##### 2. Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.
Ensuring that all data adheres to a schema (structured field: value pairing for all records in the database)

##### 3. Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.
Imagine you sell widgets online. Each user that creates a profile is allowed exactly one email address; this is a one-to-one relationship (one user one email and vice versa one email relates to one user). Now let's say you're running company reports you're a small company so John Doe may be heading multiple departments (HR, PR, Marketing) this is a one to many relationship. with regard to your sales, you may find that many of your customers  place multiple orders for widget type A,this is a many-to-many relationship (multipole customers have multiple orders)
