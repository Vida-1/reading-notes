I intended to gloss over this article but it's proving to be more interesting that it appeared at first glance, I'll need to set aside weekend time to finish it properly.


#### [Read this article on CSS Transforms](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)
This article pertains to transform syntax there are 2D and 3D transforms and they're supported across all browsers to varying degrees for the 2D transforms there is a 2D rotate property as well as a 2D scale, translate and skew property you can also combine the transform properties to new and interesting outcomes.

There is a perspective property that you can put on the parent a element that will preside over the child elements with regard to perspective there is a reference to perspective origin both of which have their own properties and values.

With regard to 3D transforms again you have the 3D rotate, scale, translate, and skew capabilities and shorthand entry options for these transforms. The transform-style property needs to go on the parent element above any nested ones.

There is backface visibility and some sample code on what this entails in the article.
