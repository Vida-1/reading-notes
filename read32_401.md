1. How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)

A reducer is a (pure) function that takes in two things (state and an action) and reduce it down to one thing (an updated state) which is this function's return. This type of function allows a dev to consolidate all the state update logic more concisely than would otherwise be possible. `useReducer` is a hook that takes as arguments a reducer function and an action and returns an array that holds the new current state and a dispatch function.  

The `useContext` hook allows state to be pulled from a top-level Provider to relevant components via Consumers rather than necessitating that props be passed down through components where they are not needed. 

So combining `useReducer` and `userContext` allow for cleaner, more deliberate coding and state management.
