## AWS: S3 and Lambda

[AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

1. What is a Amazon S3?
To me Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) service appears to be a cloud-based footlocker. For the low-low cost of just (several) pennies collected with variable frequency, you can upload your data in whatever form it may take (photo of Aunt Bea checking expiration dates in the pantry, an mp3 of that song you karaoked the heck out of that one time at sleepaway camp, the video of your puppy nose-booping a butterfly). That data will be securely stored, replicated, and accessible at lightning speed from wherever in the world you feel it should be made available.

2. Name some use cases for Amazon S3.
  * archiving
  * holding tank for data analysis
  * dynamically accessed asset bucket

3. Name some benefits of using Amazon S3.
  * cloud-based precludes the need to procure, dedicate, & maintain hardware
  * it's replicated regionally around the world (loss risk mitigation)
  * speed of retrieval

[AWS Lambda Basics](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda)

1. What is AWS Lambda?

From my understanding of the reading Lambda is a blackbox of gnomes that do a bunch of work for you. You can't see inside of the blackbox (so you don't know if those are happy little gnomes or if they are being forced to work under appalling conditions) but because of the black box you don't have to maintain servers or do a lot of work related to the functions operating on your data that you would otherwise have to attend to. 

2. Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.
  * scalable APIs
  * data processing

3. Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.
  * serverless means that not only do you not have to procure, dedicate, & maintain physical server hardware, you also don't HAVE to write a software server (i.e. server.js) though if you would like to to satisfy some aspect of your project you can do the latter if you so desire.

[CDN](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/content-delivery-network-cdn/)

1. What is a CDN?

_"A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos."_ 

2. How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

When a user requests webpage content the request is handled by a CDN that is (regionally) close to the user.

3. What are the benefits of employing a CDN?
Employing a CDN results in faster load times, increased protection against DoS attacks and data loss (because replication) and avoids the headache of hardware issues that may be associated with employing single origin servers. 

### Reflection
1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class [README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-17/)?

Nothing fancy but I aim to learn how to use this tech!
