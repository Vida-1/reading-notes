## AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

[AWS API Gateway Overview](https://www.serverless.com/amazon-api-gateway)

1. What is Amazon API Gateway?

_"Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests."_

_"Many Serverless applications use Amazon API Gateway, which conveniently replaces the API servers with a managed serverless solution."_


2. Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?
_"Within the Serverless ecosystem, API Gateway is the piece that ties together Serverless functions and API definitions."_ 

It sounds like API Gateway fits neatly in between your app, your S3 bucket and lambda functions and your end user. Also it integrates with other AWS services that we haven't learned about yet but which may prove useful in the future.
  

3. How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?

API Gateway integrates directly or via HTTP endpoint connection.

1. What are the some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway?

Several benefits are mentioned in the article but the ones that stand out for me are: 
* Easy monitoring
* Performance, and
* RESTful API options

2. What two API types might you choose from?
* RESTful
* Websocket
  

[AWS DynamoDB Guide](https://www.dynamodbguide.com/what-is-dynamo-db/)

1. What is DynamoDB?

_"DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS)."_

2. Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?

I would recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB if you are employing AWS Lambda, and/or if the size of your MongoDB has reached a threshold that is causing latency issues.
