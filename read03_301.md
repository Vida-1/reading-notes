#### *Why This Topic Matters As it Relates to This Module*
These are tools that can utilized for more effective coding with React.

### [React Docs - lists and keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
#### 1.	What does .map() return?
"The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array." -[developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)

#### 2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
"You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces." -[reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

#### 3. Each list item needs a unique ____.
Key

#### 4. What is the purpose of a key?
"Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed." -[reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

### [The Spread Operator](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)
#### 1. What is the spread operator?
"The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a functionâ€™s arguments." -[medium.com](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)

#### 2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
Among other things, the spread operator can be used for:
* Copying an array
* Combining arrays
* Using Math functions
* Adding to state in React
-per [medium.com](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)

#### 3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

#### 4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

#### 5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

### [How to Pass Functions Between Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c05OL7XbwXU)
#### 1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
The first thing that he did was to create a function.

#### 2. In your own words, what does the increment function do?
It looks for a given name and then updates an ongoing count of how many times it found that name and returns the count to state.

#### 3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
In the video the dev accomplished this by using "this" statements to pass the name of the prop into the called method.

#### 4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
This was done with a combination of "this" statements.
