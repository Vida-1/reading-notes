## Socket.io

#### Reading

[Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

1. What is a Web Socket?

_"WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection."_

2. Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.

The client request contains the following header fields: host, upgrade, connection, sec-websocket key, protocol, and version as well as an origin url. The server must then respond with upgrade, connection and SEC-Websocket acceptance key and protocol confirmation.

3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a \_\_\_\_ from that client.

1. What does the event handler `io.on()` do?

The event handler `io.on()` listens for an "event" and when the event happens it runs a callback function to handle the event.

2. Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected

A commonly implemented proof of life check is a console log.

3. What does socket.emit() do?

_"You can create and fire custom events using the socket.emit function."_

[Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).

 Websocket is a communication protocol (a protocol lays out the steps of HOW something is done); and that Socket.io is a library (a library is a collection of tools that one utilizes to do a thing). So Websocket establishes bi-directional communication over a TCP connection and socket.io is the box of tools one pulls from to build that connection.

3. When would you use WebSockets?

You would use WebSockets when you need to establish full duplex communication over a TCP connection. Basically when you need faster than standard communication between client and server.

[TCP Handshakes Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtP5ZB3wSk)

1. Translate the gist of this video to a non-technical friend
Say you want to have a Chinese language study session with an online tutor.
First you send an appointment request to the tutor; if the tutor is available they'll accept your invitation at the appointed time, but they need to know if you want to study Mandarin Chinese language or Cantonese Chinese language. So you have to confirm one more bit of info first, but after that the two of you can freely chat back and forth during the session. This three point handshake is akin to what has to happen before a TCP communication session happens. It's always a three point handshake.
