## Bearer Authorization

[Intro to JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/)
##### 1. What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?
_"JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object."_

##### 2. When should we use JSON Web Tokens?
We should use JSON web tokens when employing authorization features like sign on (SSO). They are also useful in securing information exchanges between parties.

##### 3. Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT?
JWTs contain three parts and it's in the second, "Payload", part that claims statements are contained.

##### 1. If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?
In that instance the payload is secured from undetected change. You can see it, but you can't change the content without being detected. It's like someone finding an ATM receipt. Yeah, you can see how much is in the account, but you can't change it!

##### 2. If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, itâ€™s appended in the signature.
Both the sender and the receiver must know the hash key which is appened in the signature.

##### 3. Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.
Imagine sending a note across the room that says "Do your homework, yo." the message seems pretty straight forward. However if you're sending it to someone who knows that "yo" means "ignore everything else and be online at 4:15p today." then the message is pretty secure. It's all about the sender and the recipient having secreted meanings in the message.

##### 1. Why use JWT?
We use JWT because it is a standard that has been found to be pretty secure.

##### 2. JWT is Compact and self-contained. Describe how this is useful to a non-technical friend.
Imagine sending a secret message to your best bud but the only way to decode the message is with a secret decoder ring, or a book. Well, you'd have to ship someone either a ring or a reference book before or with each message. This would be an example of an encoding method that is NOT self-contained. Now, imagine sending a secret message that can be deciphered with the back of the paper the message was written on. Much more convenient, yes?!

##### 3. What are the three components (the structure) of a JWT signature?
a) Header, b) Payload, c) Signature

#### Reflection

##### 1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
Just to keep up.

#### `Things I want to know more about`
I really didn't absorb much of this but was also not terribly confused by it. I think as I work with it I'll become more aware of the shortcomings in my understanding.
