#### *Why This Topic Matters As it Relates to This Module*
Without a functional understanding of functional programming < knyuck knyuck > we'd make poor coders indeed!

### [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

#### 1. What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

#### 2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
A function is pure if it returns the same result if given the same argument and does cause side effects.

#### 3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
"Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable." _direct quote from the article_

#### 4. What is immutability?
The extent to which it can't be changed (with reference to state here).

#### 5. What is Referential transparency?
"Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent." _direct quote from the article"

#### 1. What is a module?
An individual file containing a chunk of code logic that is a component of a larger application. 

#### 2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
It connects modules so that the application can use it as required.

#### 3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
require('./moduleName)

#### 4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
You have to say explicitly what part of a module you need using the module.export statement.

Time to practice all of these new things!
