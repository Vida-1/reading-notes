#### 04/14/2022: Read 09 - Forms and Events

#### HTML Chapter 7: “Forms” (pp.144-175)
* Form controls live inside `form` elements.
* Every form element requires an action attribute. This value is the URL for where the information is going.
* Id attributes are useful in constructing forms they let you generate checks for valid information.
* The input element let's you create different form controls.
* Text area element is used to make multiline text input areas.
* Radio buttons limit input to just one option.
* Check boxes can be used for one or more.
* The select element creates dropdown lists.
* Adding the size attribute can let you select multiple things from a dropdown list.
* The input element with type equal file allows for document upload
* Input type submitsends the form to the server.

#### HTML Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (p.330-357)
 *	Bullet point styles are dictated by the list- style- type property. Unordered lists can use no bullet a solid disc bullet a hollow circle bullet or a square bullet.
* Ordered lists can use decimals decimal leading zeros lower alpha upper alpha lower Roman and upper Roman bullets.
* You can use images for bullets by using list- style-image property.
* List-style-position puts the marker either outside or inside the text. This means for outside the text will be hanging. For inside the bullet will be indented above any wrapping text.
* If you have empty cells in a table you have the option of putting borders around them.
*	You can also change spacing between empty cells.
*	Details on styling text input for forms can be found on page 342.
*	Styling for submit buttons field sets and legends as well as aligning form controls and cursor styles it's indicated on pages 343 through 347.
 
#### JS Chapter 6: “Events" (pp.243-292)
* Events trigger JavaScript code element is selected and event is triggered and code is right. This is called event handling.There are three ways to bind an event to an element: HTML event handlers; Traditional bank handlers; Event listeners.
* Do not use HTML event handler attributes!
* Extensive details on these three binding methods may be found on pages 252 through 259 of the text.
* Even objects give information about events and the elements on which they happened.
* Event listeners are useful allowing you to listen for information on parents however they will slow down page they use them sparingly.
* User interface events of things that happen as a result of interactions with the web browser not that HTML code. Likewise, mouse events happened interactions with mouse hardware and keyboard events are related to keyboard hardware interactions.
* This chapter also covers using event delegation, additional types of events including load, focus and blur, and mutation events as well as determining position and HTML5 specific indications.  These notes are based on a skimming of the content and revisiting this chapter is recommended (time permitting).
    
#### `Why this topic matters`
* Ingles' is a grocery store chain in my area. Some of it's stores are very, very nice, some of them not so much, but one thing that stands out about them is that they offer THE WORST online shopping experience of any major brand I've experienced to date. The front end looks OK, but just trying adding your favorite breakfast meat, or frozen burrito to your cart and you'll find that their backend is incredibly jacked up. You *might* find what you're looking for if you are patient and creative in the search terms that you use. I'm too early in my dev education to say what exactly they need help with to improve their site but they definitely need help and I suspect that event flow is part of what's wrong.
    
#### `Analogy `
* For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction; unless your form is broken then all bets are off.
        
#### `Things I want to know more about`
* At present I do not wish to know more of any of these topics; i'm in input overload over here.
