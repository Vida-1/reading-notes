## Event Driven Applications

[Event Driven Programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

#### 1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
_"Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away."_

#### 2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
_"By registering event listeners we can actually reverse the flow of communication between our objects. Rather than on object needing to reach inside another object to trigger a function, our objects can just emit events and whichever objects are listening to those event will process it in the way they have been told to. The source of an objects behavior is now entirely contained within itself, rather than needing to be accessed by external objects."_

##### 3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

Considering my current level of knowledge I am unable at this time to explain this to a non-technical friend; however, I will delve over the weekend and update this entry as soon as I am versed enough to be able to do so.

*Update* Having taken some time to go through the article again line by line, I'm afraid I have not uncovered anything new that allows me to properly answer this question.

### Additional Questions

##### Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?
Ability to apply with fluency the concepts presented.

##### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
Right now my only goal is to catch up and keep up.

#### `Things I want to know more about:`
Short (15 min?) daily mini coding exercises to promote implementation fluency at current and future stages of coding experiences.
